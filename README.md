# Satellite Imagery - Land Cover Classification
I'm learning segmentation of satellite images with U-Net. The dataset is from the DeepGlobe 2018 Land Cover Classification challenge.

The code is based on https://github.com/TarunKumar1995-glitch/land_cover_classification_unet repository. The author created a medium article at https://baratam-tarunkumar.medium.com/land-cover-classification-with-u-net-aa618ea64a1b.
